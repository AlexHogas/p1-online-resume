<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Even as a kid, I was always curious about how things worked. I'd find these old radios my dad kept in the tool shed, take
  them apart, and try to figure out how they ticked. The idea that someone had thought about all those pieces and how
  they fit together was totally mind-blowing. I didn't know it at the time, but that was the start of my journey into design</p>

<p>This curiosity led me to study computer science, where I sharpened my technical skills and passion for problem-solving.
  But something was missing—a creative spark. Then by chance, I stumbled upon graphic design, and it all clicked.</p>

<p>It was like finding the missing piece of the puzzle. The mix of art and tech really lit a fire under me. I dove headfirst into
  learning everything I could, from color theory to user experience.</p>

<p>Today, I'm a designer who loves creating beautiful, functional solutions that people connect with. My unique blend of
    technical and creative expertise lets me tackle design challenges from a fresh angle. And I'm so grateful that I get to do
    the thing I love most—be curious and find creative solutions for problems.</p>

<p>Let's connect and see what we can cook up together!</p>
